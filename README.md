### Important Python libraries and examples
1) Pandas: 
	a) Filtering subdataframe based on column values (single and multiple).
	b) Checking if dataframe is empty.
	c) Dataframe to dictionary.
	d) Reading excel,csv file and converting to dataframe.
	e) Accessing and using elements of dataframe row by row.
2) csv: Read csv and update csv functions are added in the CSV class in csv.py. Reading an input from csv file itself is very fast and sometimes better than using dataframes.
3) Output to csv: Printing an output to csv file or excel file using pandas. 
4) read_write.py: 
	a) Writing to a file
5) pulp.py: Writing model in pulp
6) Tkinter: Building basic UI. Components: Window, Frame, Label, Entry, Button. ui_tkinter.py
	a) Upload file
	b) Show file using pandastable
	c) Giving input
	d) Executing functions using inputs
	e) Displaying results
7) Opening any file (not for reading or writing). open_any_file.py
8) Shortest Path:
	a) Djikstra's Shortest Path
	b) Djikstra's Shortest Path with Priority Queue (heapq python library)
9) Various coding test examples are added.
10) MST:
	a) Prim's Algorithm: Example with complete graph and 0-1 edges.
	b) Prims's Algorithm with Priority Queue (heapq python library)
11) Dynamic Programming examples are added.
12) json: Reading and writing in json files are added.
13) graph.py: Graph algorithms are added.
	a) Depth First Search: To find connection between two nodes.
